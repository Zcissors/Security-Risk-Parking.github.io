# Flashing Security Risk Warning Page

This project contains a simple HTML page that displays a warning message in big, flashing letters. The message "I'm a security risk, I leave my computer unlocked" is designed to grab attention and fit the size of the page.

The purpose of this page is to highlight the importance of computer security by reminding users to lock their computers when they are away. This can be useful in security training sessions or as a fun reminder in a shared office environment.

The message is styled using CSS to be prominently visible and to flash continuously, ensuring it catches the viewer's eye.
